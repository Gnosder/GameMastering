# Pirates -- Why is it always pirates?
This is part 1 and 2 of a four part adventure that will take players out of Basic and into Expert.

## Act 1 -- Into Limsa Lominsa
This act is short and largely non-interactive. It serves to set-up the adventure.
"It's been 5 years since the cataclysim known as the Godfall and the nations of Eorzia are still recoving from their loses and rebuilding their homes. In this time of chaos and strife many threats asssail the nations and the free companies that defend them. With the defenders streached pearilously thin it falls to the citizens of Eorzia to don the mantel of adventuers and rise up in defense of their homes. You are such adventuers. Hailing from the island nation of La Noscea you find yourself at your nation's capital city, Limsa Lominsa, determined to present yourself to the Adventuror's guild's master in the Drowning Wench tavern and guildhall."
"Limsa Lominsa is a city of towering spires built on the coast of your island home in defiance of the raw power of the sea. This port city is famed for housing the most impressive fleet on Eorzia and as you gaze east towards the docks you can see why. Tall ships of every description bearth at the city's massive harbor and in the center of it all is the Maelstrom. The largest ship you have ever seen, it dwarfs all the others by an order of magnitutde and seems to reveal in it's place as the jewel of Limsa Lominsa."
"Seeing you eyeing the magnificent vessel a halfling, vibrant in his dress and bearing the tattoos of a sailer, approaches you."
Hubert Longholes -- Halfling Sailor, friendly, proud (of Limsa Lominsa)
    He wants to welcome the heroes and introduce them to the city. After introducing himself he asks for their names and why they're in Limsa. He gives them a map and a brief tour. He also tells them where he is staying (The Green Holdfast at the docks) if they have any questions.He also tells them of Cyrus Man-o-War who is always looking for more crew if they want to become sailors. (But Baderon Fishsbreath of the adventuer's guild is probably the best place to start. I.e. "After you meet with Baderon, if you're interested in becoming sailors like me you can meet up with Cyrus at the Man-o-War.")
### The Drowning Wench Guildhall
The Wench is an old etablishment in Limsa's Missenmast, or central spire. It's name harkens back to Limsa past as a Pirate haven. 
"The Drowning Wench wears its past on its sleave. The spacious central room is decorated with all kind of pirate parafinelia and prizes. Its proprietor Baderon sports an eyepatch and a flambouyant tricorn hat, he sees you the moment you enter the crowded establisment and waves you over to his table. 'Mac, pull up some seats for our guests.' he address you, 'you have the look of adventurers about you, I'm Baderon, the proprioter of this tavern and master of the adventuer's guild. Who might you be?'"
Baderon Fishsbreath -- Human sailor, retired. Friendly, gregarious, has salt in his veins.
    He answers their questions about the city, and a few about the world. He's more of a directory than an encyclopedia.
        For questions about the world's history see Murie at Mealvaan's Gate arcanists' guild
        For questions about the city see Rast Stormer at the Storm Command Barraks
    He always has jobs for new adventurers, but before they can work with him, they'll need to talk to Rast to get setup in the city. Rast may also have some jobs for them, but if not, they should come back.
        Rast is the Commander of the Maelstrom Guard (city guard commander) and will want to register the heroes.
    He will also mark a number of PoI on their map and give out some names in the city.
        Naldiq & Vymelli's (Smithy)
        Hawkers' Round (Market/ swapmeet)
        The Duitful Sisters of the Edelweiss (rogue guild, duelest archtype)
        Fisherman's Bottom (Guild)
        Coral Tower (Marauders' Guild, Limsa's Fighter Archtype)
        Mealvaan's Gate (Arcanists' guild, Limsa's Wizard Archtype)
        Tidal Wake (Sailor's guild, Profession guide)
        The Astalicia (Merchant's guild, in a converted tallship)
    He says they should take their time and expore the city, there's no rush to get registered.

## Act 2 -- Wet feet in the city of Ships
In this act the heroes are encouraged to explore various PoIs, but they don't have to.  The primary PoI here is at the Maelstrom Command with commander Rast, the other areas are covered in LimsaLominsa.md
### The Maelstrom Command
The command takes up one of the cities many spires. It houses the Storm guard and crew of the Maelstrom. It also serves as the legal and military hub of the city. It's most accessible area is the Maelstrom's eye, a foyer so to speak.
"The eye is a large, circular space that takes up an entire level of the spire. Desks of all sizes ring the room each with a uniformed stormguard working diligently behind them. A the center of the room has a large mosaic on the floor depicting the Maelstrom in battle against a massive sea serpent. A deputy looks up from his desk and waves you over."
    Glammad D'Voss -- young, ernest, serius
        He introduces himself and the area then asks why business they have. He'll answer questions about the Maelstrom and Stormguard.
        He'll point them to commander Rast and invite them to come back to him if they have any further questions.
