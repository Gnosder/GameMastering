Naming:
Some people have surnames, but not all. For the ones that don't they take thier surname from their occupation, guild, ship, or family. These names tend not to change, so they only come from permanent or very long term places.
    ex: a sailor named Houston who ships with the Breeched Whale may be Houston Breecher.
