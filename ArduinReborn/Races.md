# The Races of Arduin
Arduin is home to many peoples of many different origins. A non-exhaustive list is presented here:

## Human
Also sometimes called Hyur are industrious and value adaptation and exploration. Their guiding star is Kul Orkhon. They follow the others equally and build shrines to all. They hail from Abrogh, but can be found in all corners of the world.

## Dwarves
A race of stout and industrious beings from Maduin and eastern Abrogh. They value family and tradition above all else. Dwarves hold grudges for centuries and often pass them down to their children. They follow Moradin.

## Elves
Hailing from the deep and lush forests of Abrogh… [TODO: Finish]

## Halflings
It is believed that the halflings entered the world when Kul Orkhon lost a bet to Saint Da’ma. A history that is almost certainly untrue, but one which the fun loving and gregarious halflings spread with relish. While they call the gentle fields of Abrogh home, Halflings can be found anywhere there is fine food and fine pipe weed.

## Tieflings
A rare half-breed often seen as the spawn of Humans and Demons. Though it’s believed they have demonic blood, bigotry against them is rare in Abrogh as the church of Kul Orkhon long ago absolved them of their demonic ‘sins’.

## Char
A disciplined and warlike race of lionen beings. They value strength and war. They follow Sha Dalamadur and Tengri. The Char hail from Xhixhe.
 
## Au Ra
A proud race with an ancient draconic origin. They are natural leaders and build glorious structures in the light of their primary star, Tengri. They also follow Kul Orkhon, though they stay wary of his capricious nature. The Au Ra are the leaders of Sal’eth.
 
## Sylvari
A race born of nature. They grow like flowers and awaken when they bloom. Each Sylvari has a dream when they are born and they believe it is their purpose in life. Sylvari will follow their dream wherever it leads them. They follow nature herself, the Ma'hair Khan and Mot. They are believed to be native to Zance, but they flower all over the world.
 
## Norn
A race of savage giants that know only cold and strife. They are fiercely traditional and follow Rilocan the wolf and Mot the herald of death. They call the windy slopes of southern XhiXhe home.
  
## Riven
Once Hyur, this race was afflicted by a foul curse that transformed them into beasts. Though they still possess their honor they sometimes struggle against a will that is not quite their own. They worship as other Hyur do, mostly following Kul Orkhon, though they cannot deny that Dah-ren Mor calls to them. Riven are most common in Marduin and several baronies.
 
## Sayaadi
This race of beings would pass as Hyur were it not for their pitch black eyes and demonic features. It is believed that they are a more ‘pure’ version of the tieflings of Abrogh. They are most common in Sal’eth and have some enclaves in Xhixhe.  They tend to follow Kul Orkon though many suspect they worship Gael Ordus and his pit lords in secret.
 
## Vulpera
The most fearless of races. These friendly, vulpine nomads follow Saint Da'ma wherever he leads them and can weave tails as grand as Kul Orkhon himself (or so the bards say). They travel the world, but are most common in Sal’eth. They hold a special kindred to Halflings and view them as cousins. They’re more at home around a campfire than in a city.
