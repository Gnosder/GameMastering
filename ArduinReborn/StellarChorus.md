# The Stellar Chorus (Gods and Deities)
The Chorus is made up of major and minor stars as well as 'wanderers'. With the exception of Tengri and Kul Orkhon they do not have set times where they rise and fall. Instead they are 'alive' and exert their will on the world, though rarely overtly.
 
## Major Stars
Tengri the Gold -- the 'Sun' of Arduin and leader of the chorus, sky god represented by the Zinogre. 
 
Kul Orkhon -- The silver star and 'Moon' of Arduin a mystic and storyteller, represented by the Kirin.
 
Sha Dalamadur -- The red star, King of war and 'he who lives in the high tower', represented by the Dala Wyrms that scale the crags of Marduin.
 
Dah-ren Mor -- The copper or 'beast' star, sometimes known as the maw, often seen to foreshadow beast men attacks.
