No one remembers what the world of Arduin was like before the Eye of Chaos arose. Arduin as it is today is a series of verdant floating continents over a vast, elemental ‘Beneath’.  

## The 5 Lands of Arduin
### Abrogh
The land of Airships and freedom. Home of the Auth’heim Dominion, The Jhequa Free States, and many smaller city nations. The largest city on Arbogh is ‘The City of Gates’ in the Auth’heim Dominion (though the Dominion’s capital is Auth’el) and is the center of commerce for the island.

### Marduin
A rugged and hilly land, known for its war loving clans, dwarves, and ale.
(Inspiration: Medieval Scotland)
### Sal’eth
Ruled by the El’al’ain Imperium.
(Inspiration: Dune by Frank Herbert; Persia and Egypt to the south east, Greek to the north west )
### Xhixhe
(Inspiration: Genshin Impact Liyue; WoW Vrykul; pre-imperial china in the central ‘Eden’ valley, mongolia in the southern stepps, norway in the frozen tundra south of the mountains.)
### Zance
An uninhabited and unexplored land. Kept separate by the Eye of Chaos and and unpredictable weather patterns around it.
(Inspiration: PoE Vaal; D&D Chult; Mayan and Aztec influences, Amazon and Sahara environs)

## The Baronies of Arduin
(Small island and city states separate from the 5)
The Trade Winds
	An archipelago on the chaos side of Marduin, a primary trade hub of the 5. All trade into and out of Abrogh, Marduin, and Sal’eth travels through here. Governed by the council of Trade Princes.

## Meta-physical planes
### The Deathlands
The deathlands are the realms of the dead. It is said that the spirits of the dead enter the deathlands for their journey to the ‘Source’*. It’s said that as they travel, the souls of the departed shed their fears, sins, and regrets — collectively called Malice — and can only attain the source when they are pure.

On occasion a rift opens into Arduin and the congealed Malice of the deathlands leeches into the world. It is this malice that creates shades and undead. Shades being Malice without form or a body, Undead being mortal shells possesed (or in the case of Living Undead, corrupted) by the Malice. Creatures of Malice are always seen as evil and are condemned and hunted by all major factions.

(A note on Necromancy: Though it is seen as evil for its ties to the Deathlands and Malice, it is not inherently so. Necromancy is the magic not just of death, but of where life and death meet and so is also seen as a force of balance. Necromantic servitors, while appearing to be undead, are not typically born of Malice but from the will of the summoner; thus while they do share the power of the Deathlands, they are not tainted by Malice.)

*The Source is named differently in each religion and culture, though all see it as a type of heaven.
