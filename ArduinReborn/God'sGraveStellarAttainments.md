These powers are available to anyone who follows a given Star and binds themselves to it at the temple in the Court.

Unbound — (Meaning not pledged to any Star) Gain proficiency in 1 saving throw and 2 skills. In addition, you gain the feat ‘Lucky’ and whenever you roll a 1 on a check (and don’t reroll it) you regain 1 luck point.

Moradin — Cannot be moved against your will. While standing on ‘natural’ or Dwarven made stonework gain +2 AC. Gain proficiency in Artisan Tools.

Rilocan — Gain the abilities ‘Frost Fang’ and ‘Thunder Claw’. Lightning damage you deal bypasses resistance and immunity.
Frost Fang: Once per rest after rolling damage on an attack, you may change the attack’s damage to Cold and deal 1d10 extra cold damage to your target and all enemies within 5 feet of it. This damage bonus increases by 1d10 each time your proficiency increases.
Thunder Claw: When you deal physical damage (Non-spell), your damage dice are treated as lightning damage, though any bonuses (from Strength, magic, etc remain as they are). As a bonus action you may suppress this ability until you finish a long rest.

Sha Dalamadur — Gain Poison and Fire resistance. When you succeed on a saving throw or an attack misses you, you may spend your reaction to make a single weapon attack against one target within range.

T'ba'ku'ta — As an action you may take the form of any small, mostly harmless creature(critter, e.g. squirrel, pigeon, etc). While in this form you have 1 HP, and AC of 5, and cannot directly deal damage. While in a wild environment you are permanently under the effects of Pass without Trace and Speak with Animals, these spells may not be suppressed or dispelled. Further you can cast Speak with Plants once per rest.

Magnus Argentus — Spells you cast are done so at 1 level higher than the spell slot you use. Spells you cast no longer differentiate between friends and foes (i.e. if a spell says 3 allies within 30 ft, it instead targets the closest 3 creatures within 30 ft.). When you cast a spell you must make an Int saving throw against your spell DC to see if you have learned anything. If you fail you may not cast that spell again until you spend a long rest refining it. Only one spell may be refined during any one rest.
	Arcane Inspiration: You may only have 1 at a time, you may spend it as normal inspiration or as 1 Sorcery point.
(Cantrips do not benefit from this ability)

Mot — Spells and abilities that deal elemental damage now deal necrotic damage instead. All spells and abilities treat necrotic immunity as necrotic resistance and ignore necrotic absorption. When you deal necrotic damage you gain 50% of the damage dealt as temporary hit points for 1 hour. These temporary hit points may not exceed double your maximum hit points.

Loki — As a bonus action, create an illusionary clone at a point you can see within 30ft. As an action, you can switch places with the clone. May cast disguise self at-will. When using an ability or casting a spell with a single target, the clone may use the ability or spell against the same target. The clone does not benefit from your proficiency bonus and only deals 50% of the damage.

Akmar — When a creature with a soul is slain near you (within 60ft) you gain one ‘Soul Shard’.
You may, as an action, spend a number of soul shards to have Akmar cast a spell on your behalf. Further you may, as a bonus action, spend a Hit Die to regenerate 3 Soul Shards. You may have no more than 5 Soul Shards at any one time.
