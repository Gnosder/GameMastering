# God's Grace (formorly Elyestra)
Once known as Elyestra though that name no longer holds any meaning. Discord in the divine pantheon resulted in the God of Stars, Camalus, falling from the heavens onto Arduin. His fall and impact on Elyestra created the eye of Chaos and shattered Arduin. While he is most certainly dead, traces of his will still reside in the city. Though these traces are severely fragmented. His death also allowed his children to wrest control of the world from the divine pantheon.

Court of Players: ‘Firelink Shrine’ A group of players camped out around one of Elyestra’s gates before the Fall. When Camalus fell they were killed and their spirits trapped within the Eye of Chaos. They are free of the madness that grips Gods Grave. Led by the troubadour Ythart, they will serve as allies, vendors, and guardians to the mortals that attempt to enter the city. They want the ‘Calamity’ to be destroyed which they believe will free them from the city and allow them to pass onto the next life.

Xelcus — A stranger that left the city after the fall and took up residence within the court. He weaves fantastic tales, but speaks little of himself. He is, in fact, a shard of Camalus. He can grant demi-god Archon abilities to mortals he finds. Which he does in the hopes that they can destroy the ‘Calamity’.

The Calamity — A shard of Camalus, driven insane by the God’s death and the powers of the Eye of Chaos. It rules the Seat of the Maker’, Camalus’ skull which still contains his divine spark. (Inspiration— BotW Ganon)
