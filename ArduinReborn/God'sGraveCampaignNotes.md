# Session _ on 1/22/21
The passage to the Sun Gate has been cleared away, thanks to Toxin's Death.
Can go to The Narrows pt 1 OR Sun Gate

Soul of Toxin can be forged into Unstoppered Pouch of Toxins: As often as you'd like, you may pull a vial from this bag. When thrown vials have a random effect. The more vials that are thrown the stronger they become. Power resets daily. Area = # vials thrown

Thought Recap:
    Group says dungeons should be 1 - 2 sessions in length. This is a problem as the attrition model requires longer sessions. Each session is turning into ~3 encounters, but party resources take closer to 5 to force a retreat. So, actually... 3-4 encs is pretty solid. Getting low without getting dead and no real risk of a 'death march'.
    The fire elementals were a good fight, tough defenses, automatic damage, dex saves. Do this more.
    Idea for the finale: Sun Orb being guarded by Fallen Sun Archon and his Salamanders. Build set piece gauntlet dungeon.

    Sun Gate pt2:
        1 boss encounter, 1 puzzle enc, 1 RP enc, 2 combat inc
        The way is blocked, but a sentient statue knows an alternate way(RP); but it wants a stone hammer that was locked in the armory. The armory is being looted by Salamaners(combat) and the key is lost, but with clever thought there is a way to shortcut it(Puzzle).
        Once into the chapel the orb can be seen in the griip of a statue, but salamanders rise from pools of fire to defend it. When the orb is touched the statue comes to life to 'test' those who would claim it, but it has been corrupted.
