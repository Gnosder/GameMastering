Thought Recap:
    Group says dungeons should be 1 - 2 sessions in length. This is a problem as the attrition model requires longer sessions. Each session is turning into ~3 encounters, but party resources take closer to 5 to force a retreat. So, actually... 3-4 encs is pretty solid. Getting low without getting dead and no real risk of a 'death march'.
    The fire elementals were a good fight, tough defenses, automatic damage, dex saves. Do this more.
    Idea for the finale: Sun Orb being guarded by Fallen Sun Archon and his Salamanders. Build set piece gauntlet dungeon.

    Sun Gate pt2:
        1 boss encounter, 1 puzzle enc, 1 RP enc, 2 combat inc
        The way is blocked, but a sentient statue knows an alternate way(RP); but it wants a stone hammer that was locked in the armory. The armory is being looted by Salamaners(combat) and the key is lost, but with clever thought there is a way to shortcut it(Puzzle).
        Once into the chapel the orb can be seen in the griip of a statue, but salamanders rise from pools of fire to defend it. When the orb is touched the statue comes to life to 'test' those who would claim it, but it has been corrupted.

Node 1 -- The lava gate
    The ground of the room is uneven and looks raised in places. Fissues run haphazardly through the stone and steam boils and hisses from them. At the end of the room a large rent in the floor spews lava up in a column. The lava acts as a gate and bars passage to the rooms beyond. A handful of statues dot the entrance to the room, they seem mundane at first, but then, one turns its head and exaimnes you quizically.

    Statue of Celas the Brazen: Proud, seeks 'completion'. He knows how to get past the lava gate, but he wants his hammer back first.

Node 2 -- The armory
    The walls of the room are covered in ruined weapon racks. The rusted remains of swords and spears can be seen lying in ruin on the floor. The far wall appears to house a large vault door with an intricate looking lock. 4 snake like creatures are regarding the lock when you enter and turn to face you. They have the upper bodies of a humanoid, but the lower half of a snake. Primal fire pulses in their eyes and wisps of heat and smoke rise from their scales.

Node 3 -- Well of Flames -- 120 souls
    3 Salamander Arcons and 2 Primal Salamanders guard the orb, they let noone close to it. After they are defeated and the orb is touched the statue of a radiant archon behind the dias comes alive and 'tests' them.
