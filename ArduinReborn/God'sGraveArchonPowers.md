Barbarian — Critical hits do x3 damage, you may rage ‘at-will’ but no more than once per minute (i.e. once per fight, with no rest needed between them). While you are raging, when an attack reduces you to 0 hit points you may heal using a Hit Dice instead of falling unconscious.
(This ability modifies and replaces your level 9 and 11 abilities respectively; if/when you hit those levels you’ll get new ones).

Bard — For each unique action you take you gain a stacking +1 bonus to all rolls you make. This bonus is lost if you repeat an action. As a bonus action you may choose to end your bonus to grant all allies within 30ft double the bonus to their next ability roll until the end of your next turn. (Actions are: Attack, Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, Use an Object/Interact; PHB 192)

Cleric — (Trickery Domain) Whenever you cast a spell you may also do one of the following: 
Magically steal one small object the target is in possession of that they are not holding and that you can see.
Gain partial cover versus the next attack against you as you fade from view.
Cause a small distraction with a ‘prank’ (note: the impact of this depends on the prank and the targets)
Allow one ally you can see to take a hide action with advantage
Grant 1 ally within 5ft temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom Modifier
Further, once per day when you would become bloodied you may use your reaction to cast Mirror Image and have one of your duplicates take the hit instead.

Paladin — Your Divine Smite no longer requires spell slots; You may smite a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma Modifier; each smite does damage as if you had spent your highest spell level. After you smite, you gain a divine aura which imposes disadvantage on any enemy attack made that does not target you. This aura lasts 3 rounds and extends 15 feet around you.
(This works out to higher damage per smite, and you get to keep your spells, but you get slightly fewer smites per day)

Ranger— You know how to take and preserve trophies from the creature you kill. These come in two sizes: small trophies can be displayed on your person, while large trophies require a lodge or display space(think home or HQ). You may display one small and any number of large trophies at a time. Each trophy grants a bonus based on the creature its from and from its power relative to you.
Examples:
Gnoll Braid (Small): Gain +2 to melee hit and damage while bloodied; once per rest may ‘charge’ (Take a dash action and an attack action in the same round).
Spectral Wraith Bone Splinter (Small): Reduce all non-magic ranged damage you take by 1. Once per rest may ignore cover as your arrows phase through solid material. Once per day may phase through a solid barrier no thicker than 1ft.
Spectral Hellion Fang(Small): Once per rest may charge an arrow with cold causing it to explode on impact as the spell Ice Knife of a level equal to your proficiency bonus. If the arrow is already enchanted with cold the spell level is increased.
Spectral Hellion Skull(Large):When damaged in melee combat may, as a reaction, create an aura of cold that does 1 damage per round to anyone within 5 feet of you. If a target takes 3 damage this way they are frozen in place and must make a strength check to break free.
(If a creature has a trophy you want, the GM will let you know what it does)
(Small trophies are always more powerful than large since they have to be on you and you can only have one)
(The Court can count as a Display Space, so long as you get their permission)

Wizard— Spells without the ritual tag may be cast as a ritual, but take 1 hour to do so. You may create up to 3 ‘ritual scrolls’ which may be used to make 1 non-ritual spell take 5 minutes to cast, this spell may be of a level up to 1 lower than your highest level. Further, you gain the abilities ‘Mage Sight’ which allows you to use Detect Magic at-will and ‘Arcane Mark’ which allows you to magically write in such a way that only those with Detect Magic can see it (i.e. magical invisible ink).
