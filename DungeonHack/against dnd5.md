What do I not like:
    Racial bonues -- Races should be chosen for rp reasons and not based on stats
    Saves
    GM rolling dice
    AC
    No way to gain more prociciencies
    Attributes
    too much intrinsic power



Changes:
AC
    change to defense
    prof + dex OR Con
    Armor grants Armor and Resistance
    Light armor is 1-2
    Medium armor is 2-1
    Heavy armor is 3-0

HP
    Hit points work the same with the following changes:
        HD = 6 + CON
        HD recover 25% of HP when used
        When reduced to 0 HP mark off a death save and become unconcious. After combat fully recover HP. For each failed death save take a -1 to all d20 rolls.
    New Action -- Second Wind: spend 1 HD to recover HP and gain +1 armor and resistance
Resting
    Short rests take ~5 minutes
    Long rests take ~4 hours (1 watch)
        Long rests no longer reduce death saves
    Downtime
        Upkeep, level up, and recovery only
        The time between advantures
        Recover at least 1 death save and up to 3 (at GM call)

Damage 
    Glancing blow
        Creatures size large or larger always do half-damage on a miss
        Other creatures with high attack stats may have the 'glancing' property which is the same as above
