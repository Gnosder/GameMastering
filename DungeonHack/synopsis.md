"If you do a job, you should get paid; but sometimes you can't spend it where you are."

This story is true; In the time before time, when the worlds were new magic dominated the universe. It gave rise to great and powerful civilitations that wared and struggled and, ultimately, failed only to be quickly replaced. The ever flowing churn of conflict and chaos was seen as anathma to life so a group of powerful Magi, the Council of the Starside, rose up to correct the path of the fledgling universe. They collected all the magic into themselves and created the *Vow* -- a strucutre or order for the universe to follow. These Magi then became Gods to oversee the Vow and all that it created.

This story is true; Each of the Gods was given a task. The creation of worlds, of mortals, of good, and of evil. One such God, Zilean, was tasked with the creation of time. But so great was the task that at its completion Zilean was destroyed by the magic he unleased. Thus was time created and fractured at once. While the laws of causality layed out in the Vow did exist, innumerable cracks also appeared that bypassed those laws. The other Gods sought to contain the damage as much as possible and created a the *Veil of Time* to cover and guard the cracks.

This story is true; "The God of magic was killed by a powerful and unknown spell he wrought, releaseing magic back into the worlds"
