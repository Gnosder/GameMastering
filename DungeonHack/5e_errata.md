# Armor and Shields
PHB 144-6
## Defense
A character's defense is equal to their profeciency + Dex Or Con (whichever is higher). This replaces AC.
## Resistance
Each category of armor grants a certain amount of DR(DRP and DRM).
The base DR of armor can be modified by certain abilities.
### DRP
When you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage you reduce the damage you take by your DRP
### DRM
When you take Acid, Cold, Fire, Force, Lightning, Necrotic, Poison, Radiant, or Thunder Damage you reduce the damage you take by your DRM.
(Note DRM does not apply to psychic damage).
## Shields
Shields grant DR like armor.
They can also be damaged to fully negate an attack that does not bypass its DR.
Wooden shields are destroyed while metal shields become broken.
A broken shield grants half (rounded down) of its base DR and if it becomes broken again is destroyed.

A character also regains any encounter use abilities.
A character may also spend HD to recover limited use abilities (see ability entry).

## Long Rest
A period of extended downtime that lasts at least 4 hours (down from 8 hours) or 1 watch.
