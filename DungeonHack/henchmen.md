## Gaining a henchperson
They can be hired or recuited. A tier i henchman can typically be attracted to a static settlement for free. Tier ii henchmen require coin, promises, tribute, etc. A combat henchmen almost always requires a half-share or more and imposes an XP penalty. Tier iii henchmen cannot be recruited and denote a character that has become special to the players.

## To use a Hench
Using a henchperson is fairly simple. They can make skill rolls in place of PCs. Only Combat henchpeople can use skills in combat.
Henchpeople without the combat tag stay at camp or in a cleared expidition site. If they are attacked, henchpeople are able to defend themselves, but do so as basic militia.

## Maintain your hench stable
All henches have morale on a 1 - 10 scale. After each expidition they make a morale check, but only if their morale is below 3. 
Started Morale is typically 7 modified by reputation.
