## BECMI - What is it?
    Stands for:
        Basic -- Levels 1-3, basic advancemnt
        Expert -- Levels 4-14, wilderness adventuring, etc
            Hirlings, reputation
        Companion -- Levels 15-25, Stronghold
        Master -- Levels 26-36+, Kingdoms/domains, mass warfare, etc
        Immortal -- 36+, Becoming a demi-god

## How do I incorporate BECMI?
    I want to build a framework for useing these ideas without tying them to XP. Why not?
    It doesn't always make sense to grind through 15 levels before you can build a stronghold. Especially when it can take 3-4 sessions per level. (I also still want most character power to fall into magic items and not class abilities; but, how does spellcasting work with that?)
    This is worth examining.
