# Pillars
    Roleplay -- Requires choice
    Conflict -- Requires stakes
    Exploration -- Requires discoveries and rewards

# Action system
Each action has a difficulty, set by the GM
    roll 2d6 
    +1d6 for each advantage and/or aid from a player
    -1d6 for each disadvantage
    +2 if you are skilled or for each ally you outnumber the enemy by
    -2 per each enemy if you are outnumberd
    Only players roll

    Compare the number rolled to the difficulty, if the number is higher the petitioner wins
    If the number is lower the petitioner loses and suffers effects of failure
    (In combat this means if you beat your targets defense, you deal damage to them; if you fail to beat their defence you take damage instead)



# Destiny and Doom
At the start of each expidition, gain Destiny tokens equal to 3 + the number of players
At any time a player may:
    Spend 1 destiny to gain +1d6 to a roll and +1 XP
    Spend 1 destiny to trade 2d6 for +1 to a roll and gain +1 XP
    Burn (remove from play) 1 destiny to negate the negative effects of a failure
    All spent destiny become Doom at the end of the scene
At any time the GM may:
    Spend 1 Doom to force a player to reroll a single die
    Spend 3 Doom to force a player to reroll all dice
    (Only 1 option can be used per roll)
    All spent Doom become Destiny at the end of the scene

# Health and Damage 
Each player character has 5 HP by default; 3 stamina HP, 2 Meat HP
Each attack does 1 damage by default
If a 6 is rolled damage is increased by 1
With a brief rest all stamina HP is recovered

# Recovery
Resting recovers all HP, unless the character is below 3 in which case they recover 1 HP (2 with bed rest and medicine)

# Expiditions
An expidition begins when a settlement is left.
